# [INTRODUCTION](#introduction)

## [Background and Motivation](#background-and-motivation)

In professional football, gaining a competitive edge increasingly relies on actionable insights derived from data. This project addresses that need by systematically monitoring and analyzing player contributions across Europe‚Äôs top leagues. The core objective is to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in performance metrics‚Äîinsights that can guide clubs in refining their recruitment strategies, tactical planning, and player development initiatives. Furthermore, analyzing league-level statistics provides valuable context for comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of various football competitions, enriching our overall understanding of the sport.

> This initiative delivers an in-depth evaluation of team and player performances across the top six first-division football leagues worldwide, covering the period from 2020 to 2025. Using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as goals, assists, and disciplinary actions, the project presents a comprehensive, data-driven dashboard. By integrating multiple performance metrics, it supports informed decision-making for a wide range of stakeholders, including club managers, scouts, and sports analysts.

## [Data sources](#data-sources)

The raw data for this project comes from football statistics originally scraped from the [Transfermarkt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfermarkt) website. The dataset consists of multiple CSV files containing information on competitions, matches, clubs, players, player valuations, and appearances. It is automatically updated on a weekly basis. Each file includes attributes specific to an entity, along with unique IDs that allow the files to be joined together for analysis.

We access this dataset through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores), downloading it directly into the `data/` folder of our GitHub repository using the **Kaggle API**. For more details about the dataset, refer to [our instructions](./data/README.md) or visit the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores).


## [Objectives](#objectives)

The key objectives for our project are:
Certainly! Here's a clearer, more professional rewrite of your project objectives:

### Key Objectives of the Project:

1. **Data Extraction and Structuring**
   Extract raw football datasets from Transfermarkt, transform them into a clean, structured format, and store them in a centralized data lake for further processing.

2. **Data Processing and Integration**
   Process and integrate relevant datasets to create a unified, reliable source of truth. This step involves exporting the consolidated data as an external table into a data warehouse, utilizing orchestration tools and distributed computing frameworks to handle large-scale transformations efficiently.

3. **Data Modeling and Transformation**
   Convert the external table into materialized views or tables within the data warehouse. These tables are designed to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics essential for tracking player, team, and league performance.

4. **Data Visualization and Analysis**
   Build interactive dashboards to visualize the KPIs and perform in-depth analysis of players, clubs, and leagues‚Äîenabling actionable insights and data-driven decision-making.


## [DATA PIPELINE](#data-pipeline)

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project is running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Power BI trial accounts, both of which will expire on **July 23, 2025**. ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

To achieve the project objectives, we have built a complete end-to-end data pipeline. The pipeline begins with raw football data sourced from Kaggle (originally scraped from Transfermarkt) and culminates in a Power BI dashboard designed to deliver actionable insights on players, teams, and leagues.

## [Tools/ Resources Used](#tools-resources-used)

1. **Terraform** ‚Äì Used to provision and manage GCP infrastructure as code in a consistent and repeatable manner.

2. **GCP Compute Engine virtual machine** ‚Äì Served as the main processing node for running data pipeline components and orchestration tools.

3. **GCP Cloud Storage** ‚Äì Acted as the data lake for storing raw and intermediate datasets extracted from Kaggle.

4. **GCP BigQuery** ‚Äì Functioned as the data warehouse for storing transformed datasets and running analytical queries.

5. **GCP Dataproc** ‚Äì Enabled distributed data processing using Apache Spark for efficient transformation of large datasets.

6. **Power BI** ‚Äì Used to build interactive dashboards for visualizing KPIs and analyzing player, team, and league performance.

7. **Docker/docker-compose** ‚Äì Containerized project components to ensure consistent environments for development, orchestration, and deployment.

8. **Mage.ai** ‚Äì Served as the data orchestration tool to automate, schedule, and monitor pipeline tasks from extraction to transformation.

9. **DBT Cloud** ‚Äì Used to define, test, and manage SQL-based data transformations and materialized views in BigQuery.

10. **Spark/pySpark** ‚Äì Handled large-scale data transformations and processing tasks within the Dataproc cluster.

11. **git/git lfs** ‚Äì Managed source code versioning and efficiently tracked large files such as datasets and notebooks.

12. **Kaggle API** ‚Äì Automated the download of raw football datasets from Kaggle into the project‚Äôs `data/` folder.

13. **VS Code** - IDE used for development, debugging, running Bash/shell terminal and source version control.

## **üîÅ Reproducibility**
*Reproducibility of this project can be ensured by following the instructions for each step below.*

1. **Download Data** ‚Äì Download raw football data on player appearances and competitions from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
   üëâ [Instructions](./data/README.md)

2. **Set Up Environment** ‚Äì Configure your Google Cloud environment, including project setup, service accounts, SSH access, and a Compute Engine VM.
   üëâ [Instructions](./gcp-cloud-infrastructure/README.md)

3. **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** ‚Äì Use Terraform to provision essential GCP resources like a Cloud Storage bucket, BigQuery dataset, and Dataproc cluster.
   üëâ [Instructions](./terraform-iac/README.md)

4. **Containerized Data Orchestration (Mage.ai)** ‚Äì Use Mage as an orchestration tool to build an ETL pipeline that structures raw data and exports it to Cloud Storage.
   üëâ [Instructions](./mage-orchestrator/README.md)

5. **Distributed Data Processing (PySpark + Dataproc)** ‚Äì Use PySpark on a Dataproc cluster to transform structured data into a unified dataset and export it to BigQuery as an external table.
